###Title: Market Movements and Election Day: Analyzing Stock Price Volatility in the U.S. Presidential Election Days
Authors: Bidita and Pure


Introduction:
This project examines stock price volatility for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), and Nasdaq Composite during U.S. presidential elections, focusing specifically on the changes in closing prices from October to November of each election year. Using historical data from Yahoo Finance and election dates, we analyze stock market behavior during these pivotal moments. Instead of paying $20 to access and download the data, we copied and pasted the data directly into Excel and downloaded it into a CSV file. Fortunately, there were no missing cells and the data was complete. However, there were some minor issues when we tried to clean the data and convert the data to the datetime format. It filtered out some parts of the data and probably got confused with the other relevant column, e.g., volume. Later on, we figured out a way to fix it using column selections by choosing only the Date and Close columns instead, we then had the clean data in the right format for the visualizations.
During the election periods, the stock market is always hard to predict how the investors react in regards to the election polls, the uncertainty of the future policies between the two opposing parties, and economic forecasts from the news. Hence, we want to analyze the volatility of the stock market and observe the movement through the visualization, seeking to answer the question: How volatile is the stock market during these swinging times of the year? By isolating election-specific data, we calculate the percentage change in closing prices to identify patterns of volatility and market reaction. The visualizations include line graphs highlighting the overall trends in stock prices over the period of time for which data is collected and bar graphs showcasing the percentage change in stock prices during each election year. The bars are color-coded to reflect political affiliation, with blue bars representing Democratic terms and red bars representing Republican terms. This provides additional context to assess the relationship between political leadership and market trends.This approach offers a focused perspective on how elections influence short-term market performance, revealing insights into the interplay between political events and financial market stability.
